IST Lab Reservation System
Optimizing Laboratory Resource Management

1. Introduction
The IST Lab Reservation System is a comprehensive web-based solution designed to streamline the scheduling and utilization of laboratory resources in educational and research institutions. By automating the reservation process, the system:

Eliminates scheduling conflicts

Ensures equitable access to lab facilities

Reduces administrative overhead

Enhances operational efficiency for students, faculty, and researchers

Built with modern web technologies, the system provides an intuitive interface while integrating seamlessly with institutional infrastructure.

2. System Architecture
The system follows a three-tier architecture for scalability and maintainability:

Frontend Layer
Technologies: HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript (ES6+)

Features:

Responsive UI for desktop and mobile

Real-time availability calendars

Interactive reservation forms

User role-based dashboards (Students/Staff/Admins)

Backend Layer
Framework: Python with Flask (RESTful API)

Key Functions:

User authentication/authorization

Reservation conflict detection

Resource allocation logic

Integration with institutional systems

Database Layer
RDBMS: SQLite (Production: PostgreSQL/MySQL compatible)

Data Model:

Users (Students, Faculty, Admins)

Laboratories (Resources, Equipment)

Reservations (Time slots, Status)

Audit Logs (For compliance)

Integration
Single Sign-On (SSO): LDAP/Active Directory support

APIs: Flask-based endpoints for frontend-backend communication

Webhooks: Notifications via email/SMS

3. Key Objectives
Goal	Implementation
Resource Optimization	Dynamic slot allocation with priority scheduling for research projects.
Conflict Resolution	Real-time collision detection and automated waitlisting.
